# Saliency-map
search for saliency map with CNN

This Project is to search for saliency points in videos. In the previous work the coordinates of the saliency points as training data are labeled. The main work of this project is the preprocessing of training data and to construct the convolutional neural network. In the end, the saliency maps of the test video is generated to verify the performance of the training results.
The Network is built and trained on the basis of the library Keras.
